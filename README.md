I'm studying the viability of creating command-line games and how I should do it.

Instead of coming up with my own game design just to try this out, though, I will use the first chapter of the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney video-game.
Later, if I succeed, I intend to design my very own games based on the code I develop here.
