<label:m1000>\
<d100>\
Inside the compressing walls of a small apartment,<w250> blood
runs all over a small statue held upside down by a man.<w1000>

<label:m2000>\
<d100>\
The blood drips from it to the wooden floor beside a fine lady's
dead body...<w3000>

<who:Phoenix>\
<adp><d40>My name is Phoenix Wright.<w1000> Here's the story:<w1000>
<adp>My first case is a fairly simple one.<w1000>

<label:m37000>\
<adp><d40>A young woman was killed in her apartment.<w1000>
<adp>The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her:<w500>
<adp>Larry Butz...<w1000> my best friend since grade school.<w1500>

<label:m38000>\
<adp><d40>Our school had a saying:<w1000>
<adp>"When something smells,<w500> it's usually the Butz."<w2000>
<adp>In the 23 years I've known him,<w250> it's usually been true.<w1000>
<adp>He has a knack for getting himself in trouble.<w1000>

<label:m39000>\
<adp><d40>One thing I can say though:<w1000> it's usually not his fault.<w500>
<adp>He just has terrible luck.<w1000>

<label:m40000>\
<adp><d50>But I know better than anyone<w250> that he's a good guy at heart.<w1000>
<adp>That and I owe him one.<w250> Which is why I took the case...<w1000>
<adp>to clear his name.<w1000>

<label:m41000>\
<adp><d50>And that's just what I'm going to do!<w3000>
